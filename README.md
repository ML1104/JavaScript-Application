JavaScript Application ReadMe

Purpose

This website is the final project for JavaScript Application Assignment - WBD4300.1

It is designed primarily to be a game overview website, where visitors would be able to view information and see images of certain games and their gameplay.

The website is simple. Once opened up you can browse the pages and read about the games. While it does not contain every piece of information available to the specific games presented, it is simply meant to provide an overview of those games to appeal to users so they can visit the actual websites of these games. Needless to say, the website is not meant to promote, but to be something like an introduction or guide to good games for new gamers, as well as veteran gamers if need be.

The website has a contact page, to serve as something like a way for users to request or ask about games. While the website only introduces top 3 games, they can easily be updated and replaced if the need arises.

Assets

The website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Bootstrap was used as the gridsystem.

Mockup of the website was done in Figma and then transported to InVision.

Different information is presented from the API depending on what is clicked using AJAX techniques.

Website created by Milos Lazarevic â€“ April 2018.
